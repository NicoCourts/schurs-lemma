## Schur's Lemma in Lean

If you'd like to work on this with me, ~~remember after cloning the repo that you should run the command `leanproject get-cache` to ensure that you have all the compiled binaries available to you (which will speed things up)!~~ clone the repository using `leanproject get https://github.com/NicoCourts/schurs-lemma`, which I believe will set everything up for you automatically. Let me know if you'd like to be added as a collaborator so you can push to the repo.

I am going to see if I can implement representations of finite groups and prove Schur's lemma.
