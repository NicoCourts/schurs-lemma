## Schur's Lemma in Lean

If you'd like to work on this with me, remember after cloning the repo that you should run the command `leanproject get-cache` to ensure that you have all the compiled binaries available to you (which will speed things up)!

I am going to see if I can implement representations of finite groups and prove Schur's lemma.
